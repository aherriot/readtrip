# Spinner

A small "working on it" indicator for loading states. A doodled spiral in `currentColor` — the
kind of absent-minded coil a bored person draws into the margin of a notebook, its hand-drawn
character in the irregular spiral geometry itself (no runtime filter — the stroke animates, so a
filter would re-rasterize every frame). A dash chases endlessly
along the spiral, like a hand that can't stop re-tracing the same doodle, rather than a
mechanical ring spinning. Unlike a tangle of crossing loops, a spiral never overlaps itself, so
it reads as one deliberate doodle, not a scribbled-out mistake. Reads on either surface with no
per-surface styling.
Source: [`components/ui/Spinner.tsx`](../../../../components/ui/Spinner.tsx).

```tsx
import { Spinner } from "@/components/ui/Spinner";

// Standing alone → name what's loading (role="status" + sr-only text)
<Spinner label="Loading your lesson" size="lg" />

// Inside an already-labelled control → decorative (no label, aria-hidden)
<Button loading>Save changes</Button>          // Button embeds a Spinner for you
<span className="text-surface-accent"><Spinner /></span>
```

## When to use

- A short async wait with no measurable progress: submitting a form, resolving a topic,
  generating a lesson/quiz. Pair it with text that says what's happening.
- Inside a `Button` while an action is in flight — prefer `<Button loading>` over placing a
  Spinner by hand; the button wires up `aria-busy` + disables itself.

## When **not** to use

- **Known, measurable progress** (quiz position, XP, calibration) → `ProgressBar`, which
  announces a real value.
- **A one-off reward beat** → the reward motion components (`RewardBurst`, etc.), not a
  spinner.
- **A whole page's first load** handled by the framework → a route-level loading UI.

## Props

| Prop        | Type                   | Default | Notes                                                                 |
| ----------- | ---------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `size`      | `"sm" \| "md" \| "lg"` | `"md"`  | `sm` inside a control, `lg` anchors a loading screen.                 |
| `label`     | `string`               | —       | Sets `role="status"` + sr-only text. Omit when decorative.            |
| `className` | `string`               | —       | Layout, or override the inherited color (e.g. `text-surface-accent`). |

## Surface

Colored with `currentColor`, so it inherits the surrounding text color automatically. Override
with a token utility (`text-surface-accent`, `text-sun`) when you want it to pop.

## Accessibility

- **Name it once.** Standing alone, pass `label` so screen readers hear what's loading. Inside
  a labelled control (a loading Button, or a screen whose heading already says it), leave
  `label` off so it isn't announced twice — then it's `aria-hidden`.
- **Reduced motion.** The dash chases via `motion-safe:animate-scribble`; the global floor
  freezes it in place, leaving the static spiral as a still (but still clearly hand-drawn)
  loading glyph when the user opts out of motion.

## Do / Don't

```tsx
// ✅ named when it stands alone
<Spinner label="Building your quiz" size="lg" />

// ✅ decorative next to a heading that already names the wait
<Heading level={2}>Building your quiz…</Heading>
<Spinner size="lg" />

// ❌ a bare, unnamed spinner as the only thing on screen (SR hears nothing)
<Spinner />

// ❌ a spinner for something with real progress — use ProgressBar
<Spinner label="Question 2 of 5" />
```
